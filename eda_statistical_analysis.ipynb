    "Diabetes is a major public health concern associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Understanding demographic and behavioral factors associated with the widespread of diabetes can help inform prevention strategies and public health interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores relationships between diabetes diagnosis and selected risk factors using public health survey data. The analysis focuses on exploratory data analysis and statistical inference rather than predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "The primary questions addressed in this analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is body mass index (BMI) significantly associated with diabetes prevalence?\n",
    "2. Do physically active individuals exhibit lower rates of diabetes compared to inactive individuals?\n",
    "3. Does diabetes prevalence differ significantly across age groups?\n",
    "4. Is income level associated with diabetes diagnosis?"
